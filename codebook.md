Variables are discribed in the "features_info.txt"" file downloaded with the original data set. (see url variable comment in run_analysis.r file)

The signals were renamed with the following pattern based on the original names vector in features.txt with the same convention of '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAccXYZ
tGravityAccXYZ
tBodyAccJerkXYZ
tBodyGyroXYZ
tBodyGyroJerkXYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAccXYZ
fBodyAccJerkXYZ
fBodyGyroXYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std Standard deviation
mad: Median absolute deviation 
max: Largest value in array
min: Smallest value in array
sma: Signal magnitude area
energy: Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr: Interquartile range 
entropy: Signal entropy
arCoeff: Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation: correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds: index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness: skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis: kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy: Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle: Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
